# AI Usage Documentation

This document describes how AI tools (ChatGPT) were used during project development.

## How AI Was Used

### 1. Library Documentation Explanation
- Asked ChatGPT to explain complex library functions and parameters
- Clarified API usage (e.g., scikit-learn, SHAP, XGBoost)
- Example: "Explain GridSearchCV parameters" or "How does SHAP TreeExplainer work?"

### 2. Spelling Correction
- Fixed typos in code comments and print statements
- Corrected grammar in documentation

### 3. Plot Code Modification
- Pasted existing plot code to adapt it for different variables
- Requested variable name changes, title updates, and layout adjustments
- Faster than manually finding/replacing all references

### 4. Translation
- Wrote parts of README.md and AI_USAGE.md in French first
- Used ChatGPT to translate to English
- Ensured accurate expression of ideas in English

## What AI Was NOT Used For

All core work was done independently:
- Algorithm implementation
- Data cleaning logic
- Model selection and hyperparameter choices
- Analysis and interpretation of results
- Project architecture and design

## Transparency Statement

This project represents my own work. AI was used only as a productivity tool for documentation, formatting, and translation tasks.
